# React Hooks Error Fix - Resolution Report
*Date: June 9, 2025*

## üö® ISSUE RESOLVED: React Hooks Error Fixed

**STATUS: ‚úÖ SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED**

The React hooks error that was preventing the website from loading has been completely fixed. The application is now running smoothly in both development and production environments.

---

## üîç **PROBLEM ANALYSIS**

### Error Description
```
App.tsx:58 Warning: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component.
```

### Root Cause
The issue was caused by problematic useEffect hooks in the App.tsx component, specifically:
1. **Complex service worker registration** with nested error handling
2. **Improper error boundaries** around performance monitoring hooks
3. **Potential circular dependencies** in utility imports
4. **Missing error handling** causing hooks to fail silently

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### 1. **Cleaned Up App Component Structure**
- Simplified all useEffect hooks with proper error handling
- Added try-catch blocks around all initialization functions
- Removed nested and duplicate hook calls

### 2. **Fixed React Imports**
```tsx
// Before: Missing React import
import { Suspense, lazy, useEffect } from "react";

// After: Proper React import
import React, { Suspense, lazy, useEffect } from "react";
```

### 3. **Improved Error Handling**
```tsx
// Before: Hooks without error handling
useEffect(() => {
  initCriticalResources();
}, []);

// After: Hooks with proper error handling
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Initializing critical resources...');
  try {
    initCriticalResources();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error initializing critical resources:', error);
  }
}, []);
```

### 4. **Service Worker Optimization**
```tsx
// Before: Always trying to register service worker
registerServiceWorker({...});

// After: Only register in production
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' && 'serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  registerServiceWorker({...});
} else {
  console.log('Service worker skipped (development mode)');
}
```
