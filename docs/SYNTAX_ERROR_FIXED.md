# ✅ SYNTAX ERROR RESOLUTION - COMPLETE

## Issue Fixed
**Problem**: Vite React SWC plugin syntax error
```
[plugin:vite:react-swc] × 'import', and 'export' cannot be used outside of module code
```

## Root Cause
Duplicate function declaration in `/src/services/resumeAnalysisService.ts`:
- `detectBuzzwords` function was declared twice
- One declaration was missing a closing brace
- This caused a syntax parsing error that affected the entire module

## Resolution Applied
1. **Removed duplicate function declaration**
   - Fixed the broken `detectBuzzwords` function
   - Removed the legacy duplicate version

2. **Cleaned up unused variables**
   - Removed unused `portfolioRegex` 
   - Removed unused `hasPortfolio` variable

3. **Verified syntax integrity**
   - All TypeScript compilation passes ✅
   - Vite development server starts successfully ✅
   - No remaining syntax errors ✅

## Current Status
- ✅ Enhanced resume analysis system fully functional
- ✅ All syntax errors resolved
- ✅ TypeScript compilation clean
- ✅ Development server operational
- ✅ Professional-grade analysis capabilities intact

## Files Modified
- `/src/services/resumeAnalysisService.ts` - Syntax fixes and cleanup

The enhanced resume analysis system is now ready for use with no blocking syntax errors!
